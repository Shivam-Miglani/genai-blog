    "text": "Hi, I am Shivam Miglani\nI build AI/ML systems and ship them to production.\nGenAI today feels like early deep learning: raw potential hitting the messy reality of deployment. The challenge isn’t “can an LLM do this?” but “can we make it reliable, observable, and affordable at scale?” That’s where I operate.\nThis is my learning space—intuition and code-first.\n\n\nWhat I Write About\nThis blog is my scratchpad for full-stack GenAI engineering, focused on:\n\nLLMs & Prompting: Making them work in production without breaking the bank\nRAG Systems: Patterns that actually work, not just demo well\nEvals: Measuring if your AI system is actually good\nAgents: Composable intelligence blocks, not magic wizards\nPapers & Case Studies: What research looks like when you implement it\n\n\n\nWhy This Space?\nI believe the best way to learn is to strip away the abstractions and build things from first principles. I hope the intuitions I write about are useful to you.\n\n\nConnect"
