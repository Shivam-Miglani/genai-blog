                "## Motivation and Meaning\n",
                "\n",
                "**R**etrieval **A**ugmented **G**eneration (RAG) is inference-time context injection: pull **relevant** external data and condition generation on it. This *grounds* responses in authoritative sources while keeping LLMs parametric knowledge (weights) frozen.\n",
                "\n",
                "#### Motivation\n",
                "- **Knowledge limited to training data**: Your proprietary/domain-specific data isn't there\n",
                "- **Fixed knowledge cut-off date**: The model can't answer questions about recent events. Without RAG, they will either refuse to answer or *hallucinate*.\n",
                "\n",
                "##### Alternatives & Trade-offs\n",
                "- Why not fine-tune?\n",
                "    - Fine-tuning excels at teaching *task formats* (SQL generation, JSON output) and *reasoning styles*, not injecting factual knowledge.\n",
                "    - **Catastrophic forgetting**: Updating knowledge degrades performance on other tasks as model weights get overwritten.\n",
                "    - **Inefficient**: requires separate fine-tuned checkpoints per domain or use-case or document. It is tricky to learn new knowledge without regressing on old knowledge even with LoRA/QLoRA. \n",
                "- Ok, why not just stuff everything in the context window?\n",
                "    - **Recall Degradation**: While 1M+ token models ace \"single-needle\" tests, performance drops significantly (to ~60-70%) when retrieving multiple distributed facts\n",
                "    - **Cost & Latency**: Processing massive contexts is computationally expensive and slow compared to vector search. Retrieval remains necessary for corpora exceeding the window size.\n",
                "- RAG is a reasonable pattern:\n",
                "    - When you need fresh, attributable knowledge with minimal model changes and can tolerate added latency.\n",
                "\n",
                "#### The RAG Pipeline\n",
                "RAG acts as a filter to inject only *relevant* context. A typical production pipeline looks like this:\n",
                "\n",
                "0. **Ingestion & Indexing**: Chunk documents, generate embeddings, and upsert into a vector database. *Note: In production, this is a continuous sync pipeline, not a one-time setup.*\n",
                "1. **Retrieval**: For a user query, search your indexed corpus (vector/keyword) and pull the top‑k relevant chunks, often followed by a *re-ranking* step for precision.\n",
                "2. **Augmented (prompt)**: Inject selected chunks into the system prompt or user message with appropriate metadata (source citations).\n",
                "3. **Generation**: The LLM generates an answer conditioned *strictly* on the provided context, minimizing external knowledge leakage."
