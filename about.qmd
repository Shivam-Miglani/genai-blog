### Hi, I am Shivam Miglani

I build AI/ML systems and ship them to production.

GenAI today feels like early deep learning: raw potential hitting the messy reality of deployment. The challenge isn't "can an LLM do this?" but "can we make it reliable, observable, and affordable at scale?" That's where I operate.

This is my learning space—intuition and code-first.

### What I Write About

This blog is my scratchpad for full-stack GenAI engineering, focused on:

- **LLMs & Prompting**: Making them work in production without breaking the bank
- **RAG Systems**: Patterns that actually work, not just demo well
- **Evals**: Measuring if your AI system is actually good
- **Agents**: Composable intelligence blocks, not magic wizards
- **Papers & Case Studies**: What research looks like when you implement it

### Why This Space?
I believe the best way to learn is to strip away the abstractions and build things from first principles. I hope the intuitions I write about are useful to you.
